# CA2-TerraformLab

Create a project using terraform for the following to host an application across clusters in twoavailability zones. You may use an architecture of your choice but you should explain yourdecisions as you go.Make sure to host your solution on github making the repository publicly available. Ensure thatyou show multiple prs to the repo to show continuous improvement.A single cluster example architecture might looklike this, but don’t forget to consider the loadbalancer, networking, etc.A multi-cluster architecture is different. A singlecluster is required as a minimal solution.
